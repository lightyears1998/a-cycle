A productivity application that evolves with me.

## Features

- ðŸš§ **Under development...** ðŸš§
- **Cross-device Synchronization** The application can be used completely offline. However, if needed, cross-device synchronization of the application can be enabled by setting up [a dedicated server](https://github.com/lightyears1998/a-cycle-server). The dedicated server software is also free and open source under the same license as this one.
  - Cross-device synchronization without server intervention is not supported yet at this time. It will be implemented in the future and coexist  the current server intervention method.
  - WebDav support is under consideration.
- **Diary** Keep a diary to memorize flashing moments in daily life.

## Develop

The project requires some GDExtension addons to work properly. You can either [compile the addons from source](https://github.com/lightyears1998/a-cycle-gdextension-source) or manually copy the addons files from a GitHub Release to the project's addons directory.

*Note: You must use the GDExtension addon files corresponding to the version of your Godot editor, or the Godot editor will crash.*
